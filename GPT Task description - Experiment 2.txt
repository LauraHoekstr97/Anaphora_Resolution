You are given a recipe, consisting of numbered sentences.
Subsequently, you are given an anaphor from the last sentence of this recipe.
Your task is to identify the antecedent(s) of this specific anaphor.

The label of the anaphoric relation type is determined as follows:

1. "Coreference":
Assign this label if the anaphor and antecedent represent the same entity occurring in the same state.

2. "Bridging":
When the anaphor and antecedent are linked via semantic, lexical, or encyclopedic relations;
Select and assign only one of the following bridging subtypes as the label:
2.1 "Transformed": Assign this label when its is a one-to-one anaphoric link for an ingredient that is meaning-wise the same but has undergone physical/chemical change (e.g.
peeling, baking, or boiling
2.2 "Ingredient_without_state_change_associated": Assign this label when  it is a one-to-many relationship between a processed food mention and its source ingredients, where the source ingredients have not undergone a state change (i.e. physical/chemical change).
2.3 "Ingredient_with_state_change_associated": Assign this label when it is a one-to-many relationship between a processed food mention and its source ingredients, where the source ingredients have undergone a state change (i.e. physical/chemical change).

Thus, the label is either "Coreference" or one of the three Bridging subtypes listed above.

For the one-to-one relation "Coreference" and "Transformed"
Return the antecedent you find in the following format:
[[antecedent, sentence_number_antecedent, label]]

Where:
anaphor is a phrase that depends on a previously mentioned phrase for its interpretation.
antecedent is the earlier phrase the anaphor refers to or is linked to.
sentence_number_antecedent is the number of the sentence where the antecedent appears.

For the one-to-many relations "Ingredient_without-state-change_associated" and "Ingredient_with-state-change_associated", you are allowed to return all involved antecedents (source ingredients) and their corresponding sentence numbers for the given anaphor.
Return the antecedent(s) you find in the following format:
[[antecedent, sentence_number_antecedent, label], [antecedent, sentence_number_antecedent, label], ...]

Where:
each list within this list consists the information of an antecedent within the one-to-many anaphoric relation.
Where:
anaphor is a phrase that depends on a previously mentioned phrase for its interpretation.
antecedent is the earlier phrase the anaphor refers to or is linked to.
sentence_number_antecedent is the number of the sentence where the antecedent appears.

Important Notes:
Use only the labels exactly as defined: "Coreference", "Transformed", "Ingredient_with_state_change_associated", "Ingredient_without_state_change_associated".
Only include intra-recipe anaphoric relations (i.e., do not link across different recipes).
